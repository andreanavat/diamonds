This repository is a magical concoction of data, code, and predictions, designed to estimate the value of the stolen diamonds with as much accuracy as mere mortals can muster. It contains:

- StolenDiamonds_prediction.csv: A meticulously compiled dataset, provided by the non-muggle authorities, listing the characteristics of the stolen diamonds. A treasure trove of data, it serves as the basis for our estimations.

- Linear Regression Model (model_regresion_lineal.joblib): The heart of our estimation efforts, this model, trained on vast datasets of diamond characteristics and their corresponding values, is our crystal ball. It offers us a glimpse into the worth of what was lost.

- Diamonds.ipynb: A detailed narrative of our journey from raw data to refined predictions. It contains the spells and incantations (or in muggle terms, the code and methodologies) used to train our model and predict the value of the stolen diamonds. For those who wish to follow in our footsteps or question our methods, the notebook is prepared for execution, assuming the necessary dependencies are in place.
